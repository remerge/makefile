# Makefile Framework

Makefile framework for all remerge projects.

## Getting Started

For a new project that does not use the Makefile framework yet, add this
repository as a subtree:

```bash
git remote add makefile https://github.com/remerge/makefile
git subtree add --squash --prefix mkf/common makefile main
```

Afterwards make targets can be included in the project:

```bash
$ cat Makefile
include mkf/common/common.mk
```

## Updating Modules

To update the Makefile framework in the current repository:

```bash
make mkf-update
```
